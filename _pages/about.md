I am broadly interested in network security and privacy, machine learning, and large-scale internet measurement.


<h5>Network Security and Privacy</h5>

I am broadly interested in areas such as network perimeter defense, anomaly detection, malware detection, and security and privacy across various network protocols and applications, including DNS, TLS, and IoT systems.

My research is dedicated to strengthening defenses in large-scale, real-world network environments by applying interdisciplinary techniques like machine learning, time-series analysis, and graph analysis.



<h5>Machine Learning</h5>

I consider machine learning an essential tool for strengthening network defenses and addressing complex cybersecurity challenges.

In my work, I employ advanced machine learning techniques to improve internet security, creating models and pipelines tailored for large-scale, real-world network environments.

Recently, I have been focused on practical machine learning challenges, such as training on imbalanced data and applying large language models to interpret network logs, adding a new layer of insight into network analysis.


<h5>Large-Scale Internet Measurement</h5>

I believe empirical assessment is essential for building resilient and secure network environments, as these evaluations guide the development of privacy-focused, secure network standards.

My research examines network security vulnerabilities and privacy practices through large-scale data analysis of network protocols and applications, including DNS, TLS, and IoT systems.
