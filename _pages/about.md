<h2> About Me</h2>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Engineering at University of Virginia, working with <a href='https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/yixin-sun'> Prof. Yixin Sun </a>. 

My PhD research centers on advancing network security and privacy by applying machine learning, data analysis, and large-scale internet measurement techniques. I focus on developing advanced machine learning solutions to tackle challenges in real-world network environments. Additionally, my research includes thorough assessments of network security vulnerabilities and privacy practices. Overall, my work aims to strengthen both the security and reliability of large-scale network infrastructures.
