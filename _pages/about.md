I have a broad interest in network security and privacy, machine learning, and large-scale internet measurement.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

**Network Security and Privacy.** 
I am broadly interested in enhancing network security and privacy across diverse protocols and applications, such as DNS, TLS, and IoT systems, as well as in developing effective defense mechanisms.

**Machine Learning and Data Science.** 
I leverage advanced machine learning techniques and time series analysis to tackle complex cybersecurity issues, developing models and pipelines optimized for deployment in real-world network settings.


**Large-Scale Internet Measurement.** I investigate security vulnerabilities and privacy practices of various network protocols and applications through large-scale data analysis.
