I am broadly interested in network security and privacy, machine learning, and large-scale internet measurement.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

**Network Security and Privacy** I am broadly interested in security and privacy across various network protocols and applications, including DNS, TLS, IoT systems, and network perimeter defenses. 


**Machine Learning** I employ advanced machine learning techniques to address complex cybersecurity challenges, creating models and pipelines tailored for large-scale, real-world network environments.


**Large-Scale Internet Measurement** I examines network security vulnerabilities and privacy practices through large-scale data analysis of network protocols and applications, including DNS, TLS, and IoT systems.
