abstract = {Transport Layer Security (TLS) is widely recognized as the essential protocol for securing Internet communications. While numerous studies have focused on investigating server certificates used in TLS connections, our study delves into the less explored territory of mutual TLS (mTLS) where both parties need to provide certificates to each other. By utilizing TLS connection logs collected from a large campus network over 23 months, we identify over 2.2 million unique server certificates and over 3.4 million unique client certificates used in over 1.2 billion mutual TLS connections. By jointly analyzing TLS connection data (e.g., port numbers) and certificate data (e.g., issuers for server/client certificates), we quantify the prevalent use of untrusted certificates and uncover potential security concerns resulting from misconfigured certificates, sharing of certificates between servers and clients, and long-expired certificates. Furthermore, we present the first in-depth study on the wide range of information included in CommonName (CN) and Subject Alternative Name (SAN), drawing comparison between client and server certificates, as well as revealing sensitive information.},

abstract = {The DNS HTTPS resource record is a new DNS record type designed for the delivery of configuration information and parameters required to initiate connections to HTTPS network services. In addition, it is a key enabler for TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) by providing the cryptographic keying material needed to encrypt the initial exchange. To understand the adoption of this new DNS HTTPS record, we perform a longitudinal study on the server-side deployment of DNS HTTPS for Tranco top million domains, as well as an analysis of the client-side support for DNS HTTPS through snapshots from major browsers. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first longitudinal study on DNS HTTPS server deployment, and the first known study on client-side support for DNS HTTPS. Despite the rapidly growing trend of DNS HTTPS adoption, our study highlights challenges and concerns in the deployment by both servers and clients, such as the complexity in properly maintaining HTTPS records and connection failure in browsers when the HTTPS record is not properly configured.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to effectively detect and prioritize malicious beaconing activities in large campus networks by profiling the server activities through aggregated signals across multiple traffic protocols and networks. Key components of our system include a novel time-series analysis algorithm that uncovers hidden periodicity in aggregated signals, and a ranking-based detection pipeline that utilizes self-training and active-learning techniques. We evaluate our detection system on 10 months of real-world traffic collected at two large campus networks, comprising over 75 billion connections. On a daily average, we detect 43\% more periodic domains by aggregating signals across multiple networks compared to single-network analysis. Furthermore, our ranking pipeline successfully identifies 1,387 unique malicious domains, out of which 781 (56\%) were unknown to the major online threat intelligence platform, VirusTotal, at the time of our detection.},
